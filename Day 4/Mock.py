# The questions
# Question 1 – Right Angled Triangle
# In file q1.py write a function called rightAngledTriangle which accepts the lengths of three sides of a triangle as parameters. The function should return whether or not the triangle is a right angled triangle.
# Arguments:
# •	An integer (the length of side 1)
# •	An integer (the length of side 2)
# •	An integer (the length of side 3)
# Return value:
# •	True 	if the sides make an right angled triangle.
# •	False 	if the sides do NOT make an right angled triangle.
# •	False 	if any side is 0 or negative.

# Question 2 – Calculate Factorial
# In file q2.py write a function called calculateFactorial which will return the factorial of a given integer.
# The factorial of an integer N is the product of the integers between 1 and N, inclusive.
# Arguments:
# •	An integer ( N )
# Return value:
# •	An integer (the factorial of the number)
# For example:
# •	If N = 5 then N factorial is 120 which is: 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
# Note:
# •	The factorial of 0 (zero) is: 1

# Question 3 – Count words that end in r or s
# In file q3.py write a function called countWords which takes as the input a string of words and returns a count of the words ending in r or s
# So the r in paper and the s in files count, but not the r in red

# Note: Change the input string to lowercase so that R and r is the same

# Arguments:
# •	A string of words (not case sensitive with spaces between them)
# Return value:
# •	An integer (containing the count of words ending in r or s)
# For example:
# •	“paper chase” would return 1 (paper ends with r)
# •	“red paper files” would return 2 (paper and files)
# •	“sss rrrrr abcdef” would return 2 (sss and rrrrr)

# Question 4 – Find duplicates in a string
# In file q4.py write a function called findDuplicates which accepts a string and returns the count of how many duplicates there are in the string.
# Arguments:
# •	A string (of any length containing letters, numbers and symbols)
# Return value:
# •	An integer (containing the count of unique duplicates in the string)
# For example:
# •	bccbbbbbb	would return 2  (b and c are duplicated)
# •	abcdef   	would return 0  (there are no duplicates)
# •	HGF hdgf 	would return 0  (there are no duplicates)
# •	##12ab   	would return 1  (the # is duplicated)
# Note: Treat the string as case sensitive. So ABC is not the same as abc
