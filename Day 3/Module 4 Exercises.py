Module 4: Strings and Text Files

1. Assume that the variable data refers to the string "myprogram.exe". Write the values of the following expressions:

a. data[2]

b. data[-1]

c. len(data)

d. data[0:8]

2. Assume that the variable data refers to the string "myprogram.exe". Write the expressions that perform the following tasks:

a. Extract the substring "gram" from data.

b. Truncate the extension ".exe" from data.

c. Extract the character at the middle position from data.

3. Assume that the variable myString refers to a string. Write a code segment that uses a loop to print the characters of the string in reverse order.

4. Assume that the variable myString refers to a string, and the variable reversedString refers to an empty string. Write a loop that adds the characters from myString to reversedString in reverse order.

5. Write the encrypted text of each of the following words using a Caesar cipher with a distance value of 3:

a. python

b. hacker

c. wow

6. You are given a string that was encoded by a Caesar cipher with an unknown distance value. The text can contain any of the printable ASCII characters. Suggest an algorithm for cracking this code.

7. Translate each of the following numbers to decimal numbers:

a. 110012

b. 1000002

c. 111112

8. Translate each of the following numbers to binary numbers:

a. 4710

b. 12710

c. 6410

9. Using the value of data from Exercise 1, write the values of the following expressions:

a. data.endswith('i')

b. " totally ".join(data.split( ))

10. Write a code segment that opens a file named myfile.txt for input and prints the number of lines in the file.

11. Write a code segment that opens a file for input and prints the number of four-letter words in the file.

12. Assume that a file contains integers separated by newlines. Write a code segment that opens the file and prints the average value of the integers.

13. Write a code segment that prints the names of all of the items in the current working directory.

14. Write a code segment that prompts the user for a filename. If the file exists, the program should print its contents on the terminal. Otherwise, it should print an error message.
